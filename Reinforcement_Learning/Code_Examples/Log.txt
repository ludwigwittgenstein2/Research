PhD -Research:


Oct 2019:

I am looking into Reinforcement Learning for engineering part of my PhD.
Currently, I am understanding background topics in Reinforcement Learning through reading
Richard Stutton's book. As of cursory reading, it seems that the field draws from extremely diverse
disciplines.


Out of Scope PhD areas:
- I wonder if Concepts in Theology, Philosophy can be infused within Reinforcement Learning?
  Ideas to incorporate in the future:
        - Middle Knowledge into an Agent in Artificial Intelligence
